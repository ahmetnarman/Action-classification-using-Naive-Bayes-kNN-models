# An Activity Recognition framework on Matlab

In this framework, two supervised learning methods were implemented that would classify different activites, whose data is provided in the .mat file. The classification performance of the two methods are given as:

| Method | Accuracy | Time |
|:-------|:-------:|:-------:|
| Naive Bayes| 97.5% | 15s |
| k-Nearest Neighbor | 98.5% | 115s|
